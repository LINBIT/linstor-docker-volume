# NAME

linstor-docker-volume - a volume plugin for docker

# SYNOPSIS

docker volume create [*dockeroptions*] \--driver=linstor [*pluginoptions*] volumename

docker container run [*dockeroptions*] \--volume-driver=linstor \--volume volumename:/data busybox sh

# DESCRIPTION

linstor-docker-volume is a daemon that is socket-activated by
*systemd(1)*. It reads http commands from a local socket and manages
*linstor(8)* resources that are replicated via *DRBD*.

# DRBD TERMINOLOGY
DRBD replicates data on a block level between multiple hosts. With DRBD it is
possible that node alpha reads (and writes) data that is actually stored on
 node bravo. In this case node alpha has a *diskless assignment* and node
bravo has a *diskfull assignment*. While even diskless nodes can access the
data in the cluster, the number of `diskfull assignments` is important,
because it corresponds to the number of full replicas in the cluster. If for
example there are *N* diskfull assignments in the cluster, *N-1* can fail
beyond repair while the data is still stored for operation or recovery on the
last diskfull node.

# OPTIONS

Plugin options are always given as options for the `docker` command and are
therefore prefixed with `--opt`. See the *EXAMPLES* section for further
information.

\--opt fs=*FORMAT*
:   Specify the file system that should be used for the new docker volume.
	 *FORMAT* can be any file system that can be created and mounted on all
	 cluster nodes where the volume should be available. If not specified, it
	 defaults to `ext4`.

\--opt fsopts=*OPTIONS*
:   Specify additional options for file system creation as a string. These options
	 are passed to the *mkfs* command. If not specified, it defaults to the
	 empty string.

\--opt size=*SIZE*
:   Specify the size of the new docker volume in *MB*. The unit is always
	 *MB*. If not specified, it defaults to a size of 100MB.

\--opt storagepool=*NAME*
:   Specify the the name of the storage pool that is used for `disful assigments`.
	 If not specified, it defaults to "drbdpool".

\--opt nodes=*NODES*
:   Specify a list of hosts this docker volume should be deployed to.
    *NODES* is a comma separated list of node names as shown by
	 *linstor node list*. A new volume is always deployed to these nodes as a
	 `diskfull assignment`. Nodes not in the list, but in the DRBD cluster get a
	 `diskless assignment` whenever needed. If not specified, it defaults to the
	 empty list. See `--opt replicas` and the end of the section for further
	 information about the interaction between these two options.

\--opt replicas=*COUNT*
:   Specify the number of nodes this volume should be deployed `diskfull`. All
    other nodes in the DRBD cluster get a `diskless assignment`. If not given
	 it defaults to 2. See `--opt nodes` and the end of the section for
	 further information about the interaction between these two options.

If none of *replicas* and *nodes* is given, the default of *replicas* will be
used. I.e., the new volume will be deployed `diskfull` to two nodes in the
cluster.

If both options, *replicas* and *nodes*, are given, the user given list of
nodes will be taken into account and `replicas` is ignored. I.e., the new
volume will be deployed to the given nodes `diskfull`.

# EXAMPLES
In the following we expect a cluster consisting of three nodes (alpha, bravo,
and charlie).

Example 1 (a typical life cycle):

On node alpha:

    $ docker volume create -d linstor \
                           --opt fs=xfs --opt size=200 lsvol
    $ docker run -it --rm --name=cont \
				 -v lsvol:/data --volume-driver=linstor busybox sh
    $ root@cont: echo "foo" > /data/test.txt
    $ root@cont: exit

On node bravo:

    $ docker run -it --rm --name=cont \
				 -v lsvol:/data --volume-driver=linstor busybox sh
    $ root@cont: cat /data/test.txt
      foo
    $ root@cont: exit
    $ docker volume rm lsvol

Example 2 (one diskfull assignment by name, two nodes diskless):

    $ docker volume create -d linstor --opt hosts=bravo lsvol

Example 3 (one diskfull assignment, no matter where, two nodes diskless):

    $ docker volume create -d linstor --opt replicas=1 lsvol

Example 4 (two diskfull assignments by name, charly diskless):

    $ docker volume create -d linstor --opt hosts=alpha,bravo lsvol

Example 5 (two diskfull assignments, no matter where, one node diskless):

    $ docker volume create -d linstor --opt replicas=2 lsvol

Example 6 (using curl without docker, useful for developers):

    $ curl --unix-socket /run/docker/plugins/linstor.sock \
			  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
			  -d '{"Name":"linstorvol"}' http://localhost/VolumeDriver.List
